        <h3>Recipe Description</h3>
        <p> A simple lamb chop recipe that can be completed in 15 minutes!
            The delicious garlic butter sauce creates makes any meat melt-in-your-mouth.
            In 5 minutes, all ingredients will be prepped. In 10-12, the lamb chop
            will be seared on a cast iron skillet and be ready to eat. The butter sauce is also
            easy to make. After the butter is melted, adding minced garlic and 
            chopped thyme will be the only steps left!

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lamb Chops</li>
            <li>Good quality butter</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Fresh thyme</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove lamb chops from the fridge 20-30 minutes before cooking and pat
                them dry with paper towels. If there is moisture on the lamb chops, you won't get a ncie sear 
                to it. Season well with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a dry cast iron skillet over a medium high heat. Then, place the chops narrow fat side down just like on the picture below. Using tongs press the chops down so that the fat renders and turns crisp and brown. This prevents the lamb chops from being overcooked while the fat renders.</li>
            <li>Once the fat has melted into the pan, lay the chops flat on one of their sides. Cook them until browned, then turn and cook on the other side. Then, add 2 tablespoons off butter (or ghee), garlic and thyme.</li>
            <li>Stir well until the butter is foaming, and spoon the butter over the lamb for a minute or so. Basting the lamb chops will add much more flavour to them.</li>
            <li>For me, it tastes best once it’s cook to medium, which means the internal temperature is 145ºF. Measure it by inserting a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat.

                If you prefer rare, the ideal temperature is 130˚F
                For medium rare is 135˚F
                For medium well is 160˚F
                For well done the ideal temperature is 165˚F
                </li>
        </ol>
