        <h3>Recipe Description</h3>
        <p>With this especially crispy and tender buttermilk fried chicken recipe, former F&W editor Grace Parisi has perfected one of our all-time favorite things to eat. A buttermilk marinade with a touch of cayenne ensures juicy meat; make sure to allow two to four hours for the chicken to soak. While it's marinating, you can mix up the flour dredge, which is spiked with garlic and onion powder to promise a crunchy, flavorful crust in every bite.

            You'll want to have an instant-read thermometer handy when it's time to fry up the chicken to ensure the oil is at the correct temperature and to test the chicken for doneness.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups of buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>4 lbs chicken parts, including medium chicken wings, thighs, and drumsticks</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
            <li>Make the buttermilk soak: In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk with the salt, black pepper, and cayenne.

            </li>
            <li>Add the chicken and stir to coat. Let stand at room temperature for 2 hours or refrigerate for 4 hours.</li>
            <li>In a large, resealable plastic bag, mix the flour with the onion powder, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne; shake to combine.

            </li>
            <li>Set a rack on a baking sheet. Working with one piece at a time, remove the chicken from the buttermilk soak, letting the excess drip back into the bowl. Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture, pressing so it adheres all over. Transfer the coated chicken to the rack and let stand for 30 minutes.

            </li>
            <li>In a deep skillet, heat 1 inch of the oil to 350°F. Set another rack over a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Fry the chicken in batches, maintaining the oil temperature at 315°F; turn once, until golden and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of each piece registers 160°F, 15 to 18 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to the rack and let stand for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Enjoy warm or at room temperature</li>
        </ol>
